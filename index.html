        <h1>In love with Bob Ross?</h1>
        <p>Bob Ross is the most celebrated tree painter to date. I can't think of anything more rewarding than being
          able to express yourself to others through painting. Now let's put some happy little clouds in here. The more
          we do this - the more it will do good things to our heart. The shadows are just like the highlights, but we're
          going in the opposite direction.</p>

          <img src="ross.png" class="img-rounded d-inline" alt="Ross Effect" width="20%" height="40%">
          <div class="d-inline" style=width:80%>
            <p>
              Pretend you're water. Just floating without any effort. Having a good day. If we're
              gonna walk though the woods, we need a little path. Even trees need a friend. We all need friends. Now
              we'll take the almighty fan brush. Fluff that up. Nothing wrong with washing your brush.</p>

            <p>There isn't a rule. You just practice and find out which way works best for you. Little trees and bushes
              grow however makes them happy. Think about a cloud. Just float around and be there. If you don't like it -
              change it. It's your world. And right there you got an almighty cloud. This is the fun part</p>

            <p>Put light against light - you have nothing. Put dark against dark - you have nothing. It's the contrast
              of light and dark that each give the other one meaning. We're not trying to teach you a thing to copy.
              We're just here to teach you a technique, then let you loose into the world. Isn't that fantastic that you
              can make whole mountains in minutes? It all happens automatically. Look at them little rascals. It's cold,
              but it's beautiful.</p>

            <p>Now then, let's play. I guess that would be considered a UFO. A big cotton ball in the sky. You can bend
              rivers. But when I get home, the only thing I have power over is the garbage. Just go back and put one
              little more happy tree in there.</p>

            <p>In nature, dead trees are just as normal as live trees. A big strong tree needs big strong roots. You
              can't have light without dark. You can't know happiness unless you've known sorrow. See there how easy
              that is.</p>

            <p>All kinds of happy little splashes. Without washing the brush, I'm gonna go right into some Van Dyke
              Brown, some Burnt Umber, and a little bit of Sap Green. We artists are a different breed of people. We're
              a happy bunch.</p>

            <p>Trees grow however makes them happy. This is a fantastic little painting. Nice little fluffy clouds
              laying around in the sky being lazy.</p>

              grow in all kinds of ways. They're not all perfectly straight. Not every limb is perfect. This is an
              example of what you can do with just a few things, a little imagination and a happy dream in your heart.
              Get away from those little Christmas tree things we used to make in school.

              into some Van Dyke Brown, some Burnt Umber, and a little bit of Sap Green. But we're not there yet, so we
              don't need to worry about it. All you have to learn here is how to have fun. Maybe he has a little friend

              make a beautiful sky? Here's something that's fun. We don't have anything but happy trees here. Remember
              how free clouds are. They just lay around in the sky all day long.
